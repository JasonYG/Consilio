Consilio

3D modeling software, like AutoCAD, is often difficult to use and unintuitive with its controls. Working in a 3D environment with 2D mouse and keyboard controls just doesn't make much sense.

Consilio is a project that allows hand motion and gestures to build mockups. Using a Leap Motion and the Xesto API, we created a proof of concept design software that makes it possible to have a 3D workspace using 3D controls.
